## Main info ## 
###############

## Routine name
routine_name: 20220130_cc_ULNanoV9_DDCvLV2_ak8

## Type of the tagger, can be 'bb' or 'cc'. This is used in the choice of proxy - e.g. for 'bb' one use
## g->bb as the proxy of bb resonance signal and extract the SF from the flavour B component.
type: cc

## Year of the UL condition. Can be 2016, 2017, 2018
year: 2017

## Prefix of the main samples produced from NanoHRT. $YEAR is a placeholder of year in format e.g. 2018
# 'sample_prefix' follows the name format as produced by NanoHRT-tools (see README)
sample_prefix: /data/pku/home/licq/hcc/new/samples/trees_sf/20220130_ULNanoV9_ak8_qcd_$YEAR

## Jet pT ranges for fit ('name' used as an identifier)
## e.g. for edges (e1, e2, e3), will define three pT range [e1, e2), [e2, e3), [e3, +inf)
pt_edges: [400, 600, 800]

## Tagger defination ##
#######################
tagger:
  ## The variable name or expression of the tagger. Name convention same to that stored under NanoAODv9.
  ## example expression: FatJet_particleNetMD_Xbb / (FatJet_particleNetMD_Xbb + FatJet_particleNetMD_QCD)
  expr: FatJet_btagDDCvLV2

  ## Span of the tagger range
  span: [0., 1.]

  ## Working points of the tagger for calibration. Format: name: [low, high]
  wps: {HP: [0.3276, 1.], MP: [0.1287, 0.3276], LP: [0.0435, 0.1287]} # these are specific to year 2017

########################
## Main analysis tree ##
########################
## Specify the main analysis tree used to extract the signal tagger shape

main_analysis_tree:
  ## The sample path: can be relative or absolute path. $YEAR is a placeholder of year in format e.g. 2018
  ## treename: the name of the tree to read in the file
  path: /data/pku/home/licq/hcc/new/samples/trees_sf/20211128_ULNanoV9_ak8_qcd_$YEAR/signal/hcc_1000.root
  treename: Events

  ## The selection used for this sample in the main analysis. This is how we enable that the g->cc 
  ## (or g->bb) jets serve as a reasonable proxy to the signal jets under the phase-space defined below
  ## *NOTE*: should always use parentheses between & and |
  selection: (fj_x_pt>400) & (fj_x_dr_H<0.8)
  
  ## Name or expression of the same tagger defined in this tree
  tagger: fj_x_btagDDCvLV2

  ## Event weight expression
  weight: genWeight*xsecWeight*puWeight

## Step 1 can be shared across all routines with the same year conditions. Uncomment this line and specify a
## previous routine run in the same condition
# reuse_mc_weight_from_routine: some_other_routine_name

## Step 4 will by default run the impact plots for the central fit point, which is time-consuming. Uncomment
## this line to skip running the impact
# run_impact_for_central_fit: false
