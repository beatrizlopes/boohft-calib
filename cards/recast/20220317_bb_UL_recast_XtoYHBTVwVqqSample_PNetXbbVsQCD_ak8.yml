## Routine name
# ====================
# to recast the results in UL Xbb calibration used in XtoYHto4b analysis, with the same configuration presented on BTV:
# https://indico.cern.ch/event/1011640/contributions/4460748/attachments/2285317/3885997/21.07.21_BTV_ParticleNet%20SFs%20for%20UL1718%20v2.pdf
# ====================
routine_name: 20220317_bb_UL_recast_XtoYHBTVwVqqSample_PNetXbbVsQCD_ak8

## Type of the tagger, can be 'bb' or 'cc'. This is used in the choice of proxy - e.g. for 'bb' one use
## g->bb as the proxy of bb resonance signal and extract the SF from the flavour B component.
type: bb

## Year of the UL condition. Can be 2016, 2017, 2018
year: 2018

## Prefix of the main samples produced from NanoHRT. $YEAR is a placeholder of year in format e.g. 2018
# 'sample_prefix' follows the name format as produced by NanoHRT-tools (see README)
sample_prefix: /data/pku/home/licq/hcc/new/samples/trees_sf/20220130_ULNanoV9_ak8_qcd_$YEAR

## Jet pT ranges for fit ('name' used as an identifier)
## e.g. for edges (e1, e2, e3), will define three pT range [e1, e2), [e2, e3), [e3, +inf)
pt_edges: [300, 400, 500, 600]

## Tagger defination ##
#######################
tagger:
  ## The variable name or expression of the tagger. Name convention same to that stored under NanoAODv9.
  ## example expression: FatJet_particleNetMD_Xbb / (FatJet_particleNetMD_Xbb + FatJet_particleNetMD_QCD)
  expr: FatJet_particleNetMD_XbbVsQCD

  ## Span of the tagger range
  span: [0., 1.]

  ## Working points of the tagger for calibration. Format: name: [low, high]
  wps: {HP: [0.94, 1.], LP: [0.94, 0.98]}


########################
## Main analysis tree ##
########################
## Specify the main analysis tree used to extract the signal tagger shape

main_analysis_tree:
  ## The sample path: can be relative or absolute path. $YEAR is a placeholder of year in format e.g. 2018
  ## treename: the name of the tree to read in the file
  path: /data/pku/home/licq/hcc/new/samples/trees/20200408_UL_X_YH_$YEAR/MX1600_MY200_nom.root
  treename: Events

  ## The selection used for this sample in the main analysis. This is how we enable that the g->cc 
  ## (or g->bb) jets serve as a reasonable proxy to the signal jets under the phase-space defined below
  ## *NOTE*: should always use parentheses between & and |
  selection: abs(DeltaEta)<1.3
  
  ## Name or expression of the same tagger defined in this tree
  tagger: pnetY

  ## Event weight expression
  weight: genWeight
